# gues_number_game

**TASK:**

Write a script that will play a guess the number game with you.

**SOLUTION:**

The program talks to the player and gives him all the instructions to play, then guides him through the game.

**NOTE:**

A very simple random number guessing game, one of my very first programs. I just checked the use of while and if/else.
